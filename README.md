This respository contains code that can be used to process microarray data downloaded from GSE76873 and presented in the following manuscript by Seshadri et al.: [Transcriptional Networks Are Associated With Resistance to Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0175844)

The two files contained in this repository are:

1. Data_Processing.R - code to process raw output from BeadStudio to that which was used as input for GSEA
2. targetsforSignalIntensityFiltering2 - table linking sample names to cohort (e.g. TSTNEG or TSTPOS)
